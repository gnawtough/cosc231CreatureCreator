            "up in the mountains of southern europe, india and tibet, there\u2019s a bird with a wingspan of almost 3 meters (10ft) and a powerful, bushy neck that likes to break bones.",
            "",
            "these huge birds were once common over southern europe and the balkans. due to the timeless and destructive nature of human panic, they were hunted almost to extinction by smooth-braided superstitionists all over the continent in the 1900s because of the hysterical assertion that this bird would carry off sheep and children.",
            "fortunately, someone with eyes eventually realised these birds don\u2019t really even eat meat, let alone live animals (or children) and work has since been ongoing to reintroduce the vultures to their previous habitats.1",
            "",
            "adult bearded vultures have a white coat around their neck and chest, which they purposefully paint a rusty red by bathing in pools thick with iron deposits and rubbing it into themselves.",
            "there\u2019s great debate as to why they take part in this behaviour, which appears to be instinctive rather than learned.",
            "researchers have suggested it may advertise strength and gives them a dominant bright orange appearance and a \u2018status symbol\u2019. while others argue it has nothing to do with appearance, and the iron dioxide might help kill bacteria on their feathers.2",
            "",
            "this might not seem like a strange thing for a bird, but in the world of vultures, it\u2019s quite unusual.",
            "while most vultures have bald necks due to the messy nature of the places they insert their heads when feeding, bearded vultures aren\u2019t concerned by the threat of a little mess around the gills, perhaps providing a hint at what they eat\u2026",
            "while humans have a stomach acid ph of around 1.5, these birds are much closer to a ph of around 1. this is very powerful stomach acid and gives you further clues as to what it puts in there.3",
            "if most vultures avoid blood and poop stains from their choice of food and have a much less acidic stomach, it\u2019s safe to say that their diet differs from the bearded vulture. and it does.",
            "the latter feeds almost exclusively on bones, which makes it very unique in the world of vertebrates.",
            "they can swallow and bite through brittle bones, before their powerful digestive system dissolves them.",
            "",
            "bearded vultures eat mostly bone, but they have no teeth to break them up.",
            "instead, if they have a bone that\u2019s too big to swallow, they\u2019ve learned to take it up to over 100 meters in the air and drop it onto the craggy rocks below.",
            "",
            "their alternative name \u2018ossifrage\u2019 translates to \u2018bone-breaker\u2019.",
            "bearded vultures will attack live prey, and tortoises are a particular favourite. they will pick up a tortoise, fly to a height and drop them onto rock so their shell cracks.",
            "other animals such as hares and reptiles like lizards have also suffered the same fate.",
            "the taxonomic name for the bearded vulture is gypaetus barbatus barbatus, which directly translates to \u201cvulture beard beard\u201d.",
            "this includes ibex, goats and steenbok (an antelope). some of these have resulted in deaths, as the bearded vulture has scared them off rocky cliffs.",
            "one of their alternative names \u2018the lammergeier\u2019 originates from the german word l\u00e4mmergeier, which means \u201clamb-catcher\u201d \u2013 in reference to the belief they attack lambs and sheep on farms.",
            "the iranian name for the bearded vulture is the huma, a mythical bird which in turkey symbolises unreachable \u2018highness\u2019. in ancient persia, it bestows kinship on those it flies over; in ottoman poetry, it is described as staying afloat in the air its entire life. other traditions grant it powers of good fortune, reincarnation and enlightenment.",
            "in europe, it was known as the devil bird, something which we\u2019re desperately trying to correct, in hindsight.4",
            "",
            "the legend of the huma has inspired an asteroid naming campaign in 2014 to come up with the name 3988 huma to label a 750m asteroid after this majestic bird, on account of the myth that it never touches the ground and that its appearance in the sky brings fortune.",
            "many vultures you may be familiar with come from the family cathartidae, which includes iconic american species like the california condor and the king vulture.",
            "bearded vultures are from a separate lineage and occupy the family accipitridae, along with the harpy eagle and the goshawks.",
            "they do share this family with theegyptian vulture, though, so they\u2019re not completely lonely.",
            "",
            "when working hard to look after a threatened species, sometimes conservationists inadvertently end up helping other species in the same ecosystem, and the ecosystem as a whole. this means that focussing efforts on certain \u2018umbrella\u2019 species is a cost-effective and efficient way of adding net gain to a conservation location.",
            "reducing poisoning efforts and protecting bearded vulture habitats has led to eagle and ibex populations stabilizing in some areas,",
            "the threats that bearded vultures face include poisoning, lead poisoning, collisions with powerlines, and intoxication from nsaids, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (like ibuprofen). so where are these vultures getting their hands on our pharmaceuticals?",
            "the use of diclofenac in livestock is very common. this is an nsaid similar to ibuprofen that farmers use on domestic animals before slaughter. unfortunately, the accumulation in the bones of these animals is high enough to cause high levels of toxicity in the vultures who consume them, leading to immune system issues, behaviour changes and even death.",
            "it\u2019s thought that this drug has been responsible for the disappearance of up to 95% of three species of old world vulture in the last two decades. conservationists are strongly emphasising the need to improve monitoring of these effects.5",

            "",
            "of course, there are valid reasons to adjust this setup temporarily, and we don\u2019t need to go into those here. the point is, up is up, down is down, and that\u2019s the way we like it.",
            "most ocean animals are like this, too, and as such, many make use of a cool adaptation called countershading. this is where their top side is dark and their bottom side is light. this is a form of camouflage, in that when you\u2019re looking up at one of these animals, you see a color similar to that of the sky above, and if you\u2019re looking down, it\u2019s less contrasted against the deep blue sea.",
            "blue sea dragons, on the other hand, have it all backwards.",
            "their top side is lighter than their foot, which is blue. that\u2019s because their floor is the sea surface, and they rest on it from underneath! like other slugs, they suction onto their substrate to get around, only in this case maybe you could call it a superstrate. the surface tension carries them from location to location through wind and ocean currents.",
            "we spend most of our time planted with our top ends pointing up and our bottom ends pointing down.",
            "",
            "all right, we may have been exaggerating a little in both the \u2018deadly\u2019 and the \u2018jellyfish\u2019 part of that sentence, but aportuguese man o\u2019 waris nothing to be trifled with. still, these little dragons make short work of them and will choose them over lettuce any day of the week.",
            "but that\u2019s not its only food; this animal has a taste for danger. a similarly jellyfish-like hydrozoan called the by-the-wind sailor is also on top of its menu, as well as the floaty violet sea snail and yet another stinging colony animal, the blue button.",
            "like terrestrial slugs, they have radular teeth. these are the same rasping, scraping teeth that are used to scratch at the flesh of your delicate vegetable on land, and in blue sea slugs, the bodies of their victims.1",

            "in the tips of its extremities lies a defensive venom that it gathers from the toxins it acquires through its stinging prey.",

            "picking up a blue sea dragon can result in a painful sting.",

            "not long ago, classrooms around the world taught kids about the food chain, and the reliance that all living things, plants and animals, ultimately have on the sun.",
            "the sun provides all of the energy for life, it was taught, regardless of if this energy is received directly \u2013 as it is with plants \u2013 or indirectly, as it is with the herbivores who feed on the plants, or the animals who eat those herbivores.",
            "",
            "except this isn\u2019t much like your common garden earthworm at all.",
            "not only do these worms live at the bottom of the deep blue sea \u2013 up to 3,600m (2.2mi) down \u2013 but they attach themselves to thermal vents, commonly belting out superheated water and gas at temperatures of up to 350\u2013380 \u00b0c. not only that, but they actually prefer vents with high amounts of particularly toxic hydrogen sulphide present.",
            "while the vents do get exceptionally hot, giant tube worms choose a sweet spot between the frigid water of the deep and the boiling hydrothermal temperatures, choosing to sit at an impressive 54\u00b0c and below.1",
            "",
            "these worms are unusual among organisms (though now we know they\u2019re not unique), in that they have no requirement for sunlight at any point in their trophic (food) web.",
            "they contain a particular kind of bacteria that thrives on the high sulphide content of the water spewing out of the vents, and this in turn provides every for the worm to live.",
            "this means that the primary energy source for these worms is entirely chemical, and suggests new possibilities of life in unusual places.2",
            "not only do they survive in these strange conditions and with these strange energy sources, but they also thrive.",
            "they are extremely fast-growing, reaching lengths of up to 1.5m (4.9ft) in under two years.",
            "this suggests that the pressure of the deep isn\u2019t as much of a hindrance to growth rates as previously thought.3",
            "nobody knows exactly how these worms colonise vents, but it\u2019s likely they do so by sending out numerous larvae into the void.",
            "these free-swimming immature versions of the worm settle where they may, and those on vents begin the process of colonizing them.",
            "changes in geological activity beneath the earth\u2019s crust might eventually mean that the vent stops flowing, and in this case, the now fixed, mature colony will die off.",
            "",
            "giant tube worms have no digestive system; instead, they\u2019re just tall columns of absorbent worm mush that can take in toxic sulphide water that is then processed internally by their symbiotic bacteria. these bacteria make sugar out of the sulphide and produce waste in the form of sulphate.",
            "the tube worm uses the sugar for growth and excretes the waste.",
            "these microbes do so much processing of the sulphide water that they effectively remove it from the surrounding environment. in fact, calculations suggest that there must be another source than the vent itself, due to the insatiable appetite that a colony of tube worms must need to grow so large, so fast.",
            "it\u2019s hypothesised that there is a secondary source of sulphide that emanates from the surrounding mud, recycled from the sulphate waste of these worms.",
            "if you\u2019re ever lucky enough to visit a hydrothermal vent, you\u2019ll likely be treated to the incredible sight of towering columns of these animals, as far as the eye can see and carpeting the sea floor in all directions.",
            "the worms form a ring around the opening of the vent, stopping at an invisible boundary where the water temperature is intolerable. this space creates a scene of a vast alien gathering of worshipping arms, permanently reaching up towards the black smoke of the volcanic chimney.",
            "of course, if you aren\u2019t ever invited to such a gathering, you\u2019ll have to watch them online like the rest of us. still, the sight is something to behold.",
            "",
            "while these animals don\u2019t eat, they do have to breathe. they do so by sending out a long red plume of gill structures that reach out into oxygenated water.",
            "this plume is rapidly retractable by a strong muscle at the opening of the tube, and will be quickly pulled out of harm\u2019s way, should a nosy crab get too close.",
            "it\u2019s surprising that it took so long to mention this, really. but unlike almost every other annelid, this worm has a strong shelled tube made out of a carbohydrate called chitin.",
            "this material is basically the animal equivalent of cellulose, which plants use for structure, and it\u2019s common in insects and crustaceans, even in molluscs, but not so common in worms!",
            "this tube is the mature worm\u2019s home, and in the end, its prison; as it can never leave.4"

        "facts": [
            "this moth was discovered in 2009 in venezuela and is said to resemble a poodle. that is, if poodles had huge wings and feathers instead of ears.",
            "",
            "any other photos you may have seen will be a different moth species, or simply fake.",
            "for example, athread on redditincluded a felt toy.",
            "",
            "this is not a real moth!",
            "ok, this isn\u2019t exclusive to poodle moths, but it is interesting. that fluff you see on its body is made of chitin, which is basically the insect equivalent of cellulose; the material that makes up the cell walls in plants.",
            "chitin and cellulose are both strong, mesh-forming polysaccharides, or sugars, and they\u2019re used for rigidity, scales, and, in this case, sound-dampening fluff for protection against bat calls.",
            "the fluff absorbs the sound and muffles the return signal, making it harder for bats to \u2018see\u2019 it with their echolocation.",
            "this poodle moth is definitely fuzzy, which means we can infer that it\u2019s going to have bats as one of its predators, even if we don\u2019t even know what it is yet.1",
            "the order lepidoptera contains all the butterflies and moths. while butterflies are relatively easy to identify from photographs, \u2013 being out in the daytime and representing just over fifty species in the uk \u2013 moths are more evasive of classification.",
            "firstly, they are almost all nocturnal, as opposed to researchers, who are mostly diurnal, but secondly, there are well over 2,000 species of moth in the uk alone, and over 160,000 species worldwide., compared with around 18,000 species of butterfly.2",
            "it\u2019s hard! moths are very diverse, and they can have very subtle differences between species that aren\u2019t always obvious without a microscope and several big pots of coffee. taxonomy of invertebrates is generally a lot more time-consuming than with larger animals.",
            "identifying to the species level, any insect as diverse as a moth, from just a photograph, brings with it a lot of issues. for example, some species are differentiated only by the number or configuration of hairs on their legs.",
            "for even more perspective, it\u2019s thought that about 75% of all species of animal anywhere on earth are insects. that\u2019s a lot of microscopy work. insects are the most diverse group of organisms we know of.",
            "but with modern technology, we are arriving at new ways to identify organisms by their genetic code. this is rapidly changing the arrangement of the biological family tree, as we discover hidden relationships between organisms.",
            "one of the most elegant demonstrations of evolution was recorded by legendary naturalist and grandfather of evolutionary biology, charles darwin. in 1862, darwin was sent a peculiar flower from an orchid found in madagascar, which had an unusually long nectar spur.",
            "understanding the relationship between plants and their pollinators, darwin hypothesised that there must be a very specialised insect that feeds almost exclusively on this nectar source, and pollinates the plant in return.",
            "he stated that scientists would eventually discover the plant\u2019s co-evolutionary partner with a foot-long proboscis. and 20 years later, they did just that. the giant malagasy hawk moth xanthopan morganii praedicta.",
            "incidentally, and harking back to the difficulty in identifying species, it\u2019s now being proposed that there are two species of these long-tongued moths. after studying the dna of the subspecies praedicta (and its genitals), researchers have concluded that it may in fact be a separate species entirely.3",
            "no.",
            "what we have here is a moth with no obvious signs of specialisation. what darwin had was a plant that clearly required a specialist to pollinate it. unfortunately, in this case, it doesn\u2019t work in reverse.",
            "if the venezuelan poodle moth\u2019s proboscis \u2013 or anything else on it, for that matter \u2013 was a foot long, we could infer a corresponding organism that it has to match with. and this might give clues as to where to look for other members of its species.",
            "but nothing particularly stands out from the photos available.",
            "the poodle moth was photographed in 2009 by kyrgyzstani zoologist dr. arthur anker in the gran sabana region of venezuela.",
            "it was uploaded to flickr with some other rather amazing moths and insects, including a \u2018goat moth\u2018.",
            "",
            "and a \u2018bolognese caterpillar\u2019.",
            "",
            "which, while bizarre \u2013 make the venezuelan poodle moth feel a littleless weird\u2013 and all appear to be genuine, from a reputable zoologist.",
            "however, many supposed images of it appear to be of a silkworm mothbombyx mori, which has a distinctly different wing arrangement, and antennae morphology and seems to comb its hair better than the example found in venezuela.",
            "",
            "other images are of muslin moths who have been speculated to be related.",
            "",
            "there are also photos of a felt toy model that are floating about similar to the reddit thread above, that claim to be a poodle moth.",
            "yes, unfortunately, no specimen was brought back, so there\u2019s not much else we can know about it. we can guess at a couple of things, though.",
            "some level of taxonomy is easy enough to guess at. we can be pretty certain it\u2019s an insect. it looks a lot like a moth. the next level down is about as far as we can reliably guess, and people who may know have guessed at lasiocampidae.",
            "this might seem like a cop-out, but the trouble with taxonomy (as if there\u2019s only one) is that there\u2019s a lot of mimicry going on in the insect world: wasps that look like ants (velvet ants), spiders that look like ants (myrmarachne spp.), cockroaches that look like ants (termites)\u2026 moths that look like wasps. the point is, that simply looking at a photo of something isn\u2019t enough to really determine what it is.",
            "dr. john e. rawlins from the carnegie museum of natural history in pittsburgh speculated the following:",
            "here\u2019s my vote/guess to id the poodle moth. the antenna is distinctive.",
            "lasiocampidae: artace or a related genus, probably not artace cribraria (presumably north america to argentina, but nobody has revised this group from mexico south). there are more than a dozen described south american species of artace, but their delimitation, validity, and even their generic placement is uncertain. it will take two things to solve this problem: a comprehensive revision of artace and kin, plus an actual specimen of a genuine \u201cvenezuelan poodle moth.\u201d",
            "definitely not lymantriidae or arctiidae, but easily confused with some megalopygidae, limacodidae, even dalceridae, and cossidae.",
            "yes\u2026.it is cute.",
            "if you were to find an albino rabbit, or one of those snakes with two heads, you might be excused for assuming it was a new species. mutations occur in every generation of a new organism, and sometimes they\u2019re quite dramatic, but a single mutation shouldn\u2019t determine the species.",
            "there\u2019s a chance this moth looks unusual because of a mutation and may be a better-known species. but as with everything about this moth: that\u2019s entirely speculative. we do know that new species are found almost daily in southern and central africa, so there\u2019s a good chance more will come out about this moth in the future."
